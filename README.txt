WKUF-Streamer-Android
=====================


This project is an android application designed to stream Kettering University's Student Radio Station, WKUF, 94.3 FM-LP.

It was created to fulfill the final project requirement of the Kettering University Course CE-491.

1. INSTALLATION
The application can be installed by copying the compiled binary (.apk) to the target device. Navigating to the file using a file system browser will allow the application to be installed.

The application can also be installed using ADB. Use the 'adb install' command to install the .apk.


2. USE
Upon opening the application, the main window is present. This window allows the user to start and stop the stream, as well as mute the audio. Muting the audio from this screen will not adjust the system volume. It will only adjust the volume of the streamer.


3. TROUBLESHOOTING INFORMATION
If no stream is playing ensure that:
A.) The device has internet connectivity.
B.) The system media volume is turned up.
